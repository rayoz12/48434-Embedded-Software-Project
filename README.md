## Notes:
Store Tariff in flash - **DONE**

	- should be able to set tariffs via tower protocol
FTM to change state to dormant after 15 seconds

2 modes - **DONE**

	-Intermediate	
	-Basic
	
RTC - to track day time

PIT - to keep track of time metering

Input conditioning circuitry - Sems like we'll have to process it in software

SW1 is on Port D pin 0. Used to cycle between displays

## TODO:
Change RMS to handle saw tooth.
Find a way to detect frequency more easily. We should also be able to do tracking on it.
