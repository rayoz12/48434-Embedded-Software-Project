Tariffs:
Store all tarrifs in flash. which means I have to expand flash to support more sectors. We need 20 bytes of space: (32 bits / 8) = 4 bytes * 5 = 20 bytes needed.
Use 3 sectors now instead of 1 (24 bytes).


Getting Tarrifs from Flash - have to store in fixed point
use 32Q24: 32 bits, 24 for fractional. Supprot tarrifs up to $256 ask if we need more.

convert the sampling interval to be defined at runtime rather than compile time
