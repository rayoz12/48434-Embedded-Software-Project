When sending the data to the terminal while sending a packet to the tower, the tower crashes.
From my investigation it crashes in random places right after you send the packet to it.
From the stack trace it starts at FIFO.c:87, FIFO_Get. 
	The line in question: OS_SemaphoreSignal(FIFO->SpaceAvailable);
	After checking the values of the Semaphores in the FIFO struct (SpaceAvailable, BufferAccess, ItemsAvailable), they are really high values: 536870912.
	Which doesn't seem correct.
