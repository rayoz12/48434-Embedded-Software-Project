Sample the channels within the PIT ISR
Calculate the power of that sample and place it into an array. (sliding window)
When we get 16 samples signal the calculate thread

scratch the above out:
Now instead use 2 arrays that hold Voltage and current. Then wait for full calculate in measure.
Average power is calculated using P=Vrms * Irms * cos(phase)
Energy we use calculate instanstanious power then firguire our period energy according to formula


The samples are a range from -32768 to 32768. We are working with a range of +-10V. So we can assume that -10Volts is -32768 and 10 volts is 32768.

so to get the voltage sampled it's a case of
sample / 3276.8


The input conditioning circuitry is an assumption. So if we put 2.3v on the function generator, interally we times by 100 to get the voltage (230v)

To get RMS:
get the highest absolute value of samples
use that as Vpk and place in RMS formula
